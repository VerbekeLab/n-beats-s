# n-beats-s
This repo contains a notebook with a PyTorch implementation of N-BEATS-S from the paper: Van Belle, J., Crevits, R., & Verbeke, W. (2022). Improving forecast stability using deep learning. International Journal of Forecasting. 
See https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016920702200098X.

The code has been developed by Jente Van Belle, Ph.D.
The PyTorch implementation of N-BEATS (Oreshkin, B. N., Carpov, D., Chapados, N., & Bengio, Y. (2019). N-BEATS: Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10437.) developed by Philippe Remy (https://github.com/philipperemy/n-beats) was used as a starting point.
