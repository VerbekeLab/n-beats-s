The code has been developed by Jente Van Belle, Ph.D.
The PyTorch implementation of N-BEATS (Oreshkin, B. N., Carpov, D., Chapados, N., & Bengio, Y. (2019). N-BEATS: Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10437.) developed by Philippe Remy (https://github.com/philipperemy/n-beats) was used as a starting point.
